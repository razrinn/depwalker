# 🚶‍♂️ DepWalker

A TypeScript-based dependency analysis tool that tracks the impact of code changes across your codebase. DepWalker analyzes your Git changes and shows you which functions are affected and their dependency chains.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Pre-commit Code Review**: See which parts of your codebase are affected by your changes before committing
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand the ripple effects of modifying a function or component
- **Test Planning**: Identify which components need testing after making changes
- **Refactoring Safety**: Verify the scope of impact when refactoring shared utilities or components
- **Code Review Assistance**: Help reviewers understand the full context of your changes
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Discover unexpected dependencies on functions you're modifying
- **React Component Changes**: Track which components are affected when updating shared hooks or context
- **Large Codebase Navigation**: Use depth limits to focus on immediate dependencies in complex projects
- **Circular Dependency Discovery**: Identify problematic circular references while analyzing impact
- **Documentation**: Generate dependency information for architecture documentation

## 📦 Installation

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v16+) and Git

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Run directly without installation:

```bash
npx depwalker
# or with options
npx depwalker --depth 3 --tsconfig ./tsconfig.prod.json
```

### Project-level Installation

Install as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev depwalker
# or
pnpm add -D depwalker
# or
yarn add -D depwalker

# Then run with npm scripts or npx
npx depwalker
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g depwalker
# Then run
depwalker
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run DepWalker in your TypeScript project directory with uncommitted changes:

```bash
# Basic usage
npx depwalker

# With depth limit (useful for large codebases)
depwalker --depth 3

# With custom tsconfig.json location
depwalker --tsconfig ./custom-tsconfig.json

# Combining options
depwalker --depth 2 --tsconfig ./build/tsconfig.prod.json
```

### Pre-commit Integration

Add DepWalker to your pre-commit workflow to analyze impact before committing:

**Option 1: Git Hook**

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "🔍 Analyzing dependency impact..."
npx depwalker --depth 3 --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json
echo "\n✅ Review the impact above before proceeding with commit."
read -p "Continue with commit? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "❌ Commit cancelled."
    exit 1
fi
```

**Option 2: Package.json Script**

Add to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "pre-commit": "depwalker --depth 3 --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json",
    "commit-check": "npm run pre-commit && echo 'Ready to commit!'"
  }
}
```

Then run before committing:

```bash
npm run commit-check
```

### Example Output

```
🔍 Changed files: [.../src/components/Button.tsx, .../src/utils/helpers.ts]

📁 Changes in: src/components/Button.tsx
==================================================

🎯 Change Source: handleClick (line ~23)
--------------------------------------------------
    ├── ButtonGroup in src/components/ButtonGroup.tsx (line ~45)
    │   └── Toolbar in src/components/Toolbar.tsx (line ~12)

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Watch mode for development (recompiles on changes)
- `pnpm build` - Build the project for production
- `pnpm test` - Run tests (currently not implemented)

### Project Structure

```
depwalker/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts        # Main application logic
├── dist/               # Compiled JavaScript output (generated)
├── package.json        # Project metadata and dependencies
├── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
├── pnpm-lock.yaml      # Lock file for dependencies
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Git Diff Analysis**: DepWalker starts by running `git diff -U0 HEAD` to get all uncommitted changes in your repository.

2. **Parse Changed Lines**: It parses the diff output to identify which TypeScript files have changes and exactly which lines were modified.

3. **Build Dependency Graph**: Using the TypeScript Compiler API, it:

   - Parses all TypeScript files in your project
   - Identifies all function declarations and variable declarations that contain functions
   - Tracks all function calls and JSX component usage
   - Builds a complete call graph with line number information

4. **Impact Analysis**: For each changed function, it traverses the dependency graph to find all functions that directly or indirectly depend on it.

5. **Visual Output**: Finally, it presents the results in a tree format showing the complete impact chain of your changes.

## 🔧 Configuration

DepWalker uses your project's `tsconfig.json` file for TypeScript compilation settings. Make sure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured for your project.

### Command Line Options

- **`-d, --depth <number>`**: Maximum depth for dependency analysis. Useful for limiting the scope in large codebases.
- **`-t, --tsconfig <path>`**: Path to the TypeScript configuration file (default: `./tsconfig.json`).

### Custom TypeScript Configuration

The `--tsconfig` option is particularly useful in these scenarios:

- **Multiple tsconfig files**: Use production, development, or test-specific configurations
- **Monorepo setup**: Point to specific package configurations
- **Custom build directories**: When your tsconfig is in a different location
- **CI/CD environments**: Use optimized configurations for analysis

```bash
# Use production configuration
depwalker --tsconfig ./tsconfig.prod.json

# Point to a different directory
depwalker --tsconfig ../config/tsconfig.analysis.json

# Monorepo package-specific analysis
depwalker --tsconfig ./packages/core/tsconfig.json
```

### TypeScript Config Requirements

Your `tsconfig.json` should include:

- Proper `include` and `exclude` paths
- Module resolution settings
- Target and lib configurations
- Correct `baseUrl` and `paths` for module resolution
